					<p><img class="contimg floatleft" src="assets/images/portfolio_pic.png"> A single word that neatly describes me:  eclectic.</p>
					<p>I'm a hybrid with a combination of skills.  I'm a digital marketer with a specialization in content and social media strategy.  And now, I'm adding web developer to my complex background.</p>  
					<p>How did I get to become all these things? Here is my story...</p>     
					<p>Sometimes dreams don't come true.  After 18 years of life in El Paso, Texas, where I was raised, I decided to pursue a career as a classical guitarist. I went to school to study music and completed a Master of Music at a prestigious music conservatory.  But around the time I was getting ready to enter the field an unfortunate thing happened...Napster.   I quickly realized I couldn't make enough of a living working as a musician, so I ended getting a second Master's degree in Integrated Marketing Communications, which I completed in 2006.</p> 
					<p>I entered the digital marketing world as a social media marketer.  This led me to start my own music blog, my first foray in web development.  I eventually transitioned to more than social media adding web strategy, email and content marketing to the mix.  In the span of my ten year marketing career, I've worked with some amazing companies brands including Cricket Wireless, The Hershey Company, Bosch Power Tools, Casa Sauza and Wolters Kluwer.</p>   
					<p>While working as a digital marketer my interest in web design and development simply got stronger. Fortunately, in today's world there is the opportunity to go attend a full stack development bootcamp.  I chose to go to Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp, which I'm in the process of completing.  (Yes, this site was one of my first assignments.)   Languages and tools I'm learning all about included HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and some Python.  Some of the tools and libraries I'm learning include Git and Github, Bootstrap, Angular, React, APIs and some other goodies we haven't talked about yet.</p>   
					<p>When I'm not learning how to code or working as a content strategist, I play my guitars, reading, cooking and spending time with my wife.</p>
